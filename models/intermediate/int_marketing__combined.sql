-- Google Ads and Facebook Ads land at different natural grains (Google's
-- daily performance lives in a separate `clicks` table keyed by ad_id;
-- Facebook's is embedded directly on `ads`, one row per ad per day) — this
-- model walks each platform's own campaign hierarchy up to a common,
-- platform-agnostic shape before combining them.
