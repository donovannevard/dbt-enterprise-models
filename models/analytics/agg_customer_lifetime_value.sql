-- Historical LTV (lifetime_value) is the actual, observed net revenue to
-- date. projected_value_1y/3y/5y is a simple run-rate projection — average
-- order value times purchase frequency, held constant forward — not a
-- churn-adjusted or probabilistic model (e.g. BG/NBD). It's meant as a
-- generic baseline every retaining-customer business can use immediately;
-- swap in a proper retention-curve or cohort-decay model per client once
-- there's enough order history to fit one.
